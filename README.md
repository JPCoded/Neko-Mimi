Animatronic cat ears controlled by arduino and gyroscope. Still work in progress but it uses 4 servos, 2 for each ear, to move the ears in different directions. The directions to move are determined by a gryscope. So when the person moves their head forward, backward, to the side, ect it will then move the ears according to preset functions.
